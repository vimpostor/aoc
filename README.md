This repo contains my personal [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for the following years:

- [2021](/2021#readme): Implemented in a different language each day for a total of 25 programming languages
- [2022](/2022#readme): Implemented entirely in Nix

Go check out the README of a particular year for more info.
