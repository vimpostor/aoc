# Advent of Code

This repo contains my personal [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for the following years:

- [2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020): Implemented entirely in Haskell
- [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021): Implemented in a different language each day for a total of 25 programming languages

Go check out the README of a particular year for more info.
