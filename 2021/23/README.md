# With Pen and Paper

Today I am solving the puzzle manually by hand, just pen and paper allowed.
You can see my notes in `main.txt`.

Unfortunately, it was next to impossible to find a real programming language
that starts with the letter **W**. There were only 3 remotely viable candidates, but all of them were an absolute pain:
- [Wyvern](https://github.com/wyvernlang/wyvern): This was probably the most viable choice out of all the three, but its syntax is endless pain. It is a bit like Java but with a more functional approach. I already had enough trouble getting the compiler to work on my system, so I ditched this choice.
- [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/): Yeah, I am absolutely not going to write such a late day in Assembly. Also I already had enough `s-expressions` in Day 19 with Scheme, so no, thank you very much.
- [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/): This is a proprietary language, and since I made it so long already without using any proprietary languages, I had to ditch this one too.

In the end, this problem was quite doable on paper though.
