This year I will use a different programming language for each day.
For day number `n` I will have to use a programming language, that starts with the `n`th letter in the alphabet.
Navigate into the different day subdirectories to learn more about the specific language that I chose for that day.

Here is the complete list of used programming languages, starting with the letter `A` for the first day and so on:

01. [Assembly](01/main.S)
02. [Bash](02/main.sh)
03. [C++](03/src/main.cpp)
04. [Dart](04/main.dart)
05. [Elixir](05/main.ex)
06. [Fortran](06/main.f08)
07. [Go](07/main.go)
08. [Haskell](08/main.hs)
09. [Idris](09/main.idr)
10. [Julia](10/main.jl)
11. [Kotlin](11/main.kt)
12. [Lua](12/main.lua)
13. [MySQL](13/my.sql)
14. [Nim](14/main.nim)
15. [OCaml](15/main.ml)
16. [Python](16/main.py)
17. [QML](17/main.qml)
18. [Rust](18/src/main.rs)
19. [Scheme](19/main.scm)
20. [Typescript](20/main.ts)
21. [Unicon](21/main.icn)
22. [Vim script](22/main.vim)
23. [With pen and paper](23/main.txt)
24. [xHarbour](24/main.prg)
25. [Zig](25/main.zig)

You may notice that I skipped the letter `Y`. This is because there are only **25 days**, but **26 letters**.
As it was incredible hard to find a programming language for that letter, I skipped it and used one starting with **Z** for the last day.
After all, this challenge was already hard enough.

In the end it was quite interesting to get to learn the similarities and differences in so many programming languages.
Let's hope for my own health, that next year I don't come up with an even crazier challenge...
