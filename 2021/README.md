This year I will use a different programming language for each day.
For day number `n` I will have to use a programming language, that starts with the `n`th letter in the alphabet.
Navigate into the different day subdirectories to learn more about the specific language that I chose for that day.

Here is the complete list of used programming languages, starting with the letter `A` for the first day and so on:

01. [Assembly](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual)
